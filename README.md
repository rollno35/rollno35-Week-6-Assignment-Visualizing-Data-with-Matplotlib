# rollno35-Week-6-Assignment-Visualizing-Data-with-Matplotlib
For this week's assignment, I chose a Kaggle dataset.
Name of the dataset : Predict Student Performance
Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/stealthtechnologies/predict-student-performance-dataset
It contains a single CSV file, named data.csv. It has 1388 rows and 5 columns. The columns are: Socioeconomic Score, Study Hours, Sleep Hours, Attendance(%) and Grade of students. By creating visualizations from this dataset, the conclusions are as follows:

1. The more time someone spends on studying, the more likely they are to get higher grades.
2. Socioeconomic score: A low to medium socioeconomic score does not really create a difference, but those with a really high socioeconomic score tend to have very good grades.
3. Hours of sleep and attendance barely have any impact on the grades.
4. Attendance: While one might expect that students with higher attendance percentages would get higher grades, the students with the highest grades happen to have very low attendance.
The marks of students were usually in the range of 35 to a little over 45, but there were a few students who scored above 70, and even up to 90.
